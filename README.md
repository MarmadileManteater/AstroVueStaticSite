# Static site built for GH pages with Astro👩‍🚀 & Vue

This is an exact recreation of my [Qwik Static Site](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/QwikStaticSite) using Astro and Vue.

I wanted to compare these two options side by side.

You can view this on 🚀gh pages [here&raquo;](https://marmadilemanteater.github.io/astro/)

I'm currently trying to figure out an issue with GH pages not serving all of the nested JS files created by my pipeline. So, you can also view this on pythonanywhere [here&raquo;](https://marmadilemanteater.pythonanyhere.com/astro/)
