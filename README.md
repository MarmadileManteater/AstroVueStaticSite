# Static site built for GH pages with Astro👩‍🚀 & Vue

This is an exact recreation of my [Qwik Static Site](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/QwikStaticSite) using Astro and Vue.

I wanted to compare these two options side by side. This is technically hosted on both pythonanywhere and github pages, but github pages is refusing to load any script files under the astro folder, so 🤷‍♀️I'm not sure what to do about that.
